    SUBJECT: A conscientious citizen<br><br>Det. Deppe,<br/> I'm a researcher at Gigacorp. I need to meet with you immediately. Meet me at Park's cafe, tomorrow at 4pm. Don't tell anyone you're coming.</p><br>

    SUBJECT: Encryption<br><br>Thank you for helping me with this. I can't trust anyone here, so I've found a way to encrypt my messages (it uses a tally system). Put this image and the password in the program on the flash drive I gave you. It should output "HELP." Tell me if it works.</p>

    SUBJECT: Update<br><br>Today, I was looking through old documents, and I found one on "proposal 032-J." I've attached the the official name given to 32-J(encrypted of course). The project is supposedly terminated, but something's still going on. I'll try and get some more information for you. I'll see you at Park's cafe.</p>

    SUBJECT: A name<br><br>I've attached the name of the lead researcher on proposal 032-J. Can you look into him? I think management's going to shut him down. I swear this is the first decision Nielsen's made that I actually agree with. I've never met the guy, but I think I'm onto something with 32-J. I'm afraid they're onto me, though. If I'm found, I don't know what they'll do, but you need to protect my wife and daughter.</p>

    <p>FROM: <mark style="background-color:white; color:white;">-------</mark><br>
    SUBJECT: Serious development<br><br> Nielsen said he blew his brains out in his lab. They found his body sitting in front of his computer, 32-J still open. I guess it didn't work out. They've contracted a smaller firm to shut it down. I've attached the name of the new scientist. Looks like 32J was a dead end. But I'm still sure something suspicious is happening. Why did management hire an outsider? Why couldn't one of us handle it?</p>

    SUBJECT: Revisiting 32J<br><br>I was wrong. 32J is definitely NOT a dead end. I don't think he killed himself. I've been looking into it, and something else definitely happened. Please investigate the name I gave you before. I'm almost certain he was involved in this death. I'm sorry you've been having problems with the encryption system. I think your decryption wasn't working because your conversion key was corrupted. I've attached another copy of it. Bring your computer to the next meeting. I'll make sure there aren't any other problems.</p>

    SUBJECT: Discovery<br><br> 32J is not dead. And its not just a linguistic learning algorithm. Up until a few weeks, it was just spitting out garbage. But a few weeks ago, a few other researchers starting noticing patterns in its speech. I think management's been trying to shut it down but they can't. Right now, its very difficult to figure out whats going on. They're trying to keep it all under wraps. Plus, Nielsen keeps asking me to write this report. But between investigating and reporting to you, I can't find the time. I think he's getting suspicious.</p>

    SUBJECT: Get me out<br><br> I stole one of the guard's ID cards, and used it to get into the security room. I went back a few weeks in the tapes and saw everything. I figured it all out, but a guard caught me. He let me go, but I think they're onto me. You need to get me out of here. I don't care where you send us, I just want my family to be safe. </p>

    <p>FROM: <mark style="background-color:white; color:white;">-------</mark><br>
    SUBJECT: Evidence<br><br> I've sent you everything I have and the password to my Gigacorp employee profile. I've rewritten the access priority, so you should have access to almost all their files. This could be huge. Its more than enough to open a bigger investigation into Gigacorp. But with this password, you no longer need me to keep investigating. You can relocate my family and then look into Gigacorp with your partner. Can you please talk to your contact in the witness protection program and get back to me?</p>
